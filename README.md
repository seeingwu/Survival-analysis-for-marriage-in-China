# Survival-analysis-for-marriage-in-China
The project is about the marital situation in China using the survival analysis methods when I took the graduated course in UC Berkeley. Motivation is that I accidently found that
the marriage life can be considered as a life duration, which means it has the "lifespan" too. For interests, I found a survey dataset containning much personal information including marital status and other background information making investigating the lifespan of the marriage possible.

# Dataset
[China Family Panel Studies (CFPS)](https://opendata.pku.edu.cn/dataverse/CFPS) is a nationally representative, annual longitudinal survey of Chinese communities, families, and individuals launched in 2010 by the Institute of Social Science Survey (ISSS) of Peking University, China. 

The CFPS is designed to collect individual-, family-, and community-level longitudinal data in contemporary China. The studies focus on the economic, as well as the non-economic, wellbeing of the Chinese population, with a wealth of information covering such topics as economic activities, education outcomes, family dynamics and relationships, migration, and health.Â 

We have the whole CFPS data recorded in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018 which can provide rich information to do social statistic inference. Each size of them is about 30000 individuals and 1000 variables. The [proposal.pptx](https://github.com/seeingwu/Survival-analysis-for-marriage-in-China/blob/main/proposal.pdf) file illustrates that how to convert the data into a survival analysis data form.

# Data process
The data process including feature selection and visualization can be found in [process.pdf](https://github.com/seeingwu/Survival-analysis-for-marriage-in-China/blob/main/process.pdf)

# Survival analysis: Causal inference and traditional COX estimates.
For comparing the causal inference and traditional survival analysis, we implemented two methods and compare the results together. The detail report is stored in [survival analysis for marriage in China.pptx](https://github.com/seeingwu/Survival-analysis-for-marriage-in-China/blob/main/survival%20analysis%20for%20marriage%20in%20China.pdf).
